        <h2>20210916</h2>
        <p>Year 1 Bay East, East Capitol, Sun Origin</p>
        <p>Left my office in Six Trees at the usual time. A little later than usual now that I think of it. What held me up was the sudden appearance of this geisha named Snowfall.</p>
        <p>Her voice was shaky. Like she was about to break down and sob at any moment. But she never did. Somehow she go the idea that I was the one to solve her problems.</p>
        <p>There was nothing new about the job. Standard cut and paste. A bit of leg work, but nothing requiring more than a few days. Of course I took the job.</p>
        <p>I was two months behind on my payments, and the Eight-Nine-Three enforcers were camped outside of my apartment. That's why I've been working out of a storage room in Six Trees and sleeping in a rent-a-box in the Green Capsule Men's Complex.</p>
